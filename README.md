**MotionSENS-PONG**

Introduction:

MotionSENS-PONG brings a refreshing twist to the classic Pong game by introducing innovative motion controls. This project marks my initial venture into practical application, created during my 12th-grade coursework. While I acknowledge my beginner status, I welcome any constructive criticismüòÅ

To run the project:

-Review the comprehensive comments within the Python script for insights into the code.
-Utilize the "requirements.txt" file via the CMD with the command: **pip install -r requirements.txt** for auto-installing required modules to run this project.
**Note: Before executing the command, ensure that your CMD's active directory is set to the project directory containing the .txt file, achieved by using the 'cd'              command in CMD**
-You can even customize in-game elements such as sprites and sounds by directing the respective items to the designated sections in the Python script.

**Experience the game and have fun! Your feedback is appreciated.** üëç

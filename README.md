# MotionSENS-PONG
*The Classic Pong Game Now With New Redefined motion Controls !!*
This is my 1st project that was made for my class 12th Practicals, so I am not a pro, I will gladly adhere to any constructive critisism !

Instructions on running the project file :
1) I have included comments explaining most of the stuff inside my .py script
2) Many libraries have been used for making this project, pls use the "requirements.txt" provided in the project file via CMD, using the **pip install -r requirements.txt**     command. **NOTE THAT BEFORE USING THE COMMAND CHANGE YOUR ACTIVE DIRECTORY INTO THE PROJECT DIRECTORY CONTAINING THE .TXT FILE VIA USING THE 'cd' COMMAND IN CMD**
3) U can easily change the ingame sprites, sounds just by directing the respected item into the correct block of code and providing its path the .py script's required area.
4) ENJOY üëç
